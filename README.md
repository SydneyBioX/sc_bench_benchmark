This repository contains the code and data to reproduce the results in "The current landscape and emerging challenges of benchmarking single-cell methods", currently available on bioRxiv (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.19.572303v1.)

In this study, we conducted a systematic literature search and assessed 245 papers, including all 95 benchmark-only papers from the search and an additional 150 method development papers containing benchmarking.

The "data.csv" is the anonymous survey response that contains information on each of the 245 papers.
